# My_JS_Chess
My version of chess made in JavaScript !

I'm doing this project mainly for fun, but I chose JavaScript over Python to prepare for my summer internship.

## Goals  
1) Create a functional chess game, including legal moves, checkmate...
2) Develop a bot to play against, (I want to experiment with the minimax algorithm).
3) Build everything from scratch, without using AI, as this is for training!
